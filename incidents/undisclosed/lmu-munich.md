## How it could have been prevented
- Use the baseline controls for this category.

### Baseline controls for this attack type
- The basics that break most ransomware chains: phishing-resistant MFA everywhere, patching edge devices fast, EDR on every endpoint and server, and no flat networks.
- Immutable, offline or logically separated backups, with restores tested against a realistic scenario.
- Data-exfiltration detection: alert on large outbound transfers and unusual cloud-storage uploads.
- Data minimisation and retention limits, because data you deleted can't be stolen.
- Keep an incident-response plan and retainer on hand, and practise the 'take the website and apps offline' decision before you need it.
